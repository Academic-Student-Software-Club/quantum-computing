# quantum-computing
A collection of my quantum computing homeworks/projects/tests.
This will just be a jumble of files of what I've created during my one quarter of PHYS 345 Quantum Computing.

-- Folder Descriptions --

  0. Qiskit Template
      - This file contains all of the libraries/initializations I found important/helpful during my learning. 
      - I tend to just copy/paste lines from this file into my actual work.
  1.  State Transformations:
      - Direct manipulation of qubits through operators such as Tensor Products and Unitary Transformations.
  2. Quantum Circuits: 
      - An attempt to describe qubit state evolution through a series of unitary transformations, and drawing of 'quantum circuits'.
  3. Quantum Fourier Transform:
      - A dedicated folder to explore the execution and applications of the QFT, namely to find periodic structures and extract information from the phases of quantum states.
  4. Misc
      - A folder to contain homeworks and examples from the remainder of the quarter, with no central topic.
